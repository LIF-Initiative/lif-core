**T-Shirt Sizing Guidelines**

This project uses t-shirt sizing to describe the relative scope and complexity of work items.

**Important:**  
T-shirt sizes do **not** represent time, hours, or delivery estimates.  
They are intended to help contributors understand scope and help maintainers prioritize work.

Sizing is based on:

* Functional change  
* Surface area of the codebase affected  
* Risks and unknowns  
* Required system understanding

**Size Definitions:**

| Size | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| XS | Very small change with minimal impact (comments, configuration tweaks, typos). |
| S | Small, self-contained change affecting a single function or component with low risk. |
| M | Moderate change introducing new behavior within an existing module or feature area. |
| L | Larger change spanning multiple components, modules or interfaces.  May require coordination or design discussion. |
| XL | Significant change affecting architecture, data models, APIs, or core workflows.  High risk or uncertainty. |
| XXL | Foundational or systemic change (major refactor, redesign, or new subsystem).  Requires design review before implementation. |
